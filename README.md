BasicSR is an open source image and video super-resolution toolbox based on PyTorch (may extend to more restoration tasks in the future).<br>
<sub>([ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN), [EDVR](https://github.com/xinntao/EDVR), [DNI](https://github.com/xinntao/DNI), [SFTGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/SFTGAN))</sub>

## Dependencies and Installation

- Python >= 3.7 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
- [PyTorch >= 1.3](https://pytorch.org/)
- NVIDIA GPU + [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

Please run the following commands in the BasicSR root path to install BasicSR:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```

Note that BasicSR is only tested in Ubuntu, and may be not suitable for Windows. You may try [Windows WSL with CUDA supports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/gpu-cuda-in-wsl) :-) (It is now only available for insider build with Fast ring).
